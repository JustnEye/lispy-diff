# lispy-diff
LispyDiff is a symbolic math engine written in Python that mimics Lisp-style expression trees. It allows you to see and understand the entire process of differentiation. Each step is shown - from the raw formula to the derivative - so that one fully knows how calculus works behind the scenes.

**Ideal for:**
- Students learning calculus or symbolic logic
- Teachers that create step-by-step differentiation walkthroughs
- Developers that build lightweight interpreters

**What it does:**
- Symbolically differentiates with respect to a variable
- Parses Lisp-style math expressions
- Simplifies expressions for clarity
- Evaluates the expressions with variable environments.
